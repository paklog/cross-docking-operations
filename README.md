# Cross-Docking Operations

Direct transfer workflows, flow-through processing, and intelligent cross-dock matching without storage, enabling rapid hub-and-spoke distribution and merge-in-transit operations.

## Overview

The Cross-Docking Operations service is a critical component of the Paklog WMS/WES platform, enabling efficient direct transfer of goods from inbound to outbound shipments without intermediate storage. Cross-docking can reduce handling costs by 20-30%, decrease order cycle time by 40%, and minimize inventory holding costs, making it essential for time-sensitive and high-velocity distribution operations.

This service implements sophisticated algorithms for cross-dock matching, load consolidation, and flow-through processing. By eliminating storage steps and coordinating tightly synchronized inbound/outbound schedules, cross-docking maximizes facility throughput while minimizing touch points and cycle time.

## Domain-Driven Design

### Bounded Context

The Cross-Docking Operations bounded context is responsible for:
- Cross-dock opportunity identification and matching
- Direct transfer workflow orchestration
- Flow-through processing coordination
- Load consolidation and deconsolidation
- Cross-dock performance optimization
- Hub-and-spoke distribution management
- Merge-in-transit operations
- Cross-dock timing window management

### Ubiquitous Language

- **Cross-Dock**: Direct transfer of goods from receiving to shipping without storage
- **Flow-Through**: Items moving directly through the facility
- **Transfer Order**: Instruction to move items from inbound to outbound
- **Cross-Dock Match**: Pairing of inbound receipt with outbound shipment
- **Consolidation**: Combining multiple inbound loads into single outbound
- **Deconsolidation**: Splitting inbound load to multiple outbound destinations
- **Cross-Dock Window**: Time period for completing direct transfer
- **Staging Lane**: Temporary holding area for cross-dock items
- **Hub-and-Spoke**: Distribution model with central hub facility
- **Merge-in-Transit**: Combining shipments from multiple origins
- **Touch Point**: Each handling event for cross-dock items
- **Flow Rate**: Velocity of items through cross-dock operation
